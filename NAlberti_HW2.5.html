<font size="6"> Academic discourse writing </font>

    <p>
Academic writing is produced by students, professors, or researchers as a
    result of any type of experiment or academic study. Generally, the goal
    is to contribute to or refute other findings in the area of interest.
    Due to this, often the writing is heavy in discipline-specific vocabulary
    and requires context of other articles.</p>
    <p style="margin-right:300px">Discourses in academia can be thought of as “sub-communities,” which center
    around a main topic or organization. They have specific languages, beliefs,
    and behaviors that compliment the shared topic. Writers should familiarize
    themselves with the discourse prior to writing, just as one would “feel” the
    tone of a conversation before joining in.</p>

<hr>

<font size="3">
Within academic discourses, sub-groups, or sub-discourses, are very common within
    large branches of fields. For example, under “psychology” there are discourses
    focused on studying the brain, and of those there may be another sub-group
    researching about specific sections of the brain.
    <p>
        Genres are one aspect of any academic discourse one considers before writing.
        A genre represents what form the writing will take, for example a journal,
        magazine article, lab report, or book. The author must adapt their tone and
        vocabulary appropriately to account for the audience and surrounding context
        of the conversation within the discourse.
    </p>
<p>
These discourses and sub-discourses are interconnected but can vary wildly. A study of
    eighty papers from different academic communities showed that soft sciences more
    frequently use citations and references to outside texts than hard sciences,
    sometimes up to twice as much. In addition, papers for history and social sciences
    tend to have introductions of greater complexity than those of other disciplines.
    In his book <i>Academic Discourse Across Disciplines,</i> Ken Hyland speculates this
    could be because soft sciences have more specialized
    individuals, while hard sciences are built upon linearly.
</p>
    <p>
        What Teresa Thonney in her paper <i>Teaching the Conventions of Academic Discourse</i>
        calls “lexical bundles” may be the most defining
        characteristics of these writings because they’re present in any academic
        discourse’s language. These bundles may consist of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>"in the case of"</li>
        <li>"this results in"</li>
        <li>"after considering"</li>
        <li>"the fact that"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It’s vital for any academic writer to learn how to correctly use such terms,
        since they can account for over 20% of the paper. It’s also very common for
        articles or papers that draw conclusions as a result of experiment or observation
        to refrain from using language that conveys certainty. Since it is a part of a
        broader conversation the author will leave room for disagreements and/or criticism.
        This language is foundational for the academic discourse, which is mastered before
        one learns how to use discipline-specific vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many students participate in academic discourses during their writing exercises.
        In their paper <i>Writing-to-Learn in Undergraduate Science Education: A Community Based,
        Conceptually Driven Approach,</i> the authors outline the importance of WTL, or writing
        to learn. They argue students should be taught to add meaningful ideas to a conversation,
        rather than simply reciting the information they’ve learned. This would require a
        student to dive into an academic community, and fully understand the discussion, then
        building off of that.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of students, a poor grade by the professor may be the only resulting consequence
        as a result of breaking the regular rules of conduct within an academic community.
        For professionals in their discipline, the aforementioned writer may be shunned, or their ideas
        disregarded by the rest of the discourse.
    </p>
    <font size="5"> <p> Authority </p> </font>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The aspect of “authority” in writing has different connotations depending on what
        discipline one is writing in, but it is present in almost every type of academic
        writing. Generally, this tone of authority conveys one of professional directness
        and reliability. Fields like engineering commonly write in third-person, in a very
        abstract fashion, sometimes even going as far as to discourage the use of a first-person
        perspective. More commonly, academia interchanges between first and third-person writing
        styles. These techniques aid in giving an active voice for the author’s writing.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <i>Teaching the Conventions of Academic Discourse</i>, Thonney acknowledges that many
        students struggle with implementing this tone into their writing, and suggests “packing
        meaning” into their words. This is done by accentuating words or phrases which actively
        engage or contribute to the writing (nouns, verbs, adverbs, etc.) and minimizing transitory
        words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions). Spoken English has a very low density of
        meaning, because little thought is often put into the construction of ideas. Academic articles and papers
        generally have a very high density of meaning, which helps portray their voice of authority.
    </p>
    <p align="center"><i>Thirty minutes after the experiment ended, the liquid turned to a darker shade of
        color.</i></p>
    <p>This sentence has a high density of meaning, and avoids extraneous words or phrases like
        <i>“it seems.”</i></p>
    <p>Specifically in science-based academic communities, authors will not speak with absolute certainty
        when analyzing results or writing a conclusion to leave room for criticism. Despite this, a voice of authority has conviction, or an aura of confidence.</p>
    <p>
        As a student or scholar gains more experience and understanding of what it means to write
        with authority, they will become more accustomed with the conventions within their discipline.
        Ann Penrose and Cheryl Geisler analyzed the differences between an experienced academic
        writer and a young English student in their text <i>Reading and Writing Without Authority.</i>
        They say their study showed the more inexperienced student tended to write to report what
        something “is,” rather than what something “does.” She wrote from an outsider perspective,
        in a very depersonalized manner. In contrast, the academic writer made a professional
        connection to the reader, where he attempted to engage them in an exploration of the topic.
        Penrose and Geisler suggest this indicates that to write with authority means to “join the
        conversation.” In this way, they say, the writer must learn the behaviors and unwritten rules
        of their academic discourse, then contribute to the conversation in a meaningful way.
